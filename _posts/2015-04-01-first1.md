I'm sitting here setting up a Raspberry Pi and I'm thinking, "I bet I'm going to do this again one day and I don't want to look all over the place to find the steps for what I did." It's not that the rest of the internet doesn't have what I need, it's just that the rest of the internet doesn't have exactly what I need in exactly one place. This blog is going to start out existing as some step-by-step tutorials for things that I do that I might do again. They may not apply to you perfectly but they do for me and they may just provide that additional bit of insight you were looking for.
