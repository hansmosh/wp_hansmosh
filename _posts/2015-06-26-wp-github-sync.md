As a developer, I love GitHub. Naturally, I wanted to make use of it for maintaining [this blog][1]. 

### Version control

GitHub is essentially a git hosting service. With git we can easilly keep track of every revision ever made to a project and its files. It doesn't take a genius to see why that would be beneficial for a blog. Expecially one in which the content should be updated often, as new technologies and strategies are developed. 

### Free public repositories

Free is always good. Unlimited free is better. Might as well make a GitHub repository for everything you do. Who knows, maybe someone will stumble across what you're up to and decide to help. 

### Collaboration

It's so easy to collaborate. Anyone can fork this blog, make any edits that they want and issue a pull request. I can review those changes and if I'm satisfied, merge them back into my master repo. The hansmosh.com Wordpress site will be updated to reflect those changes within seconds. 

## How to set it all up

It was actually really, really easy. I discovered this neat little Wordpress plugin called [Wordpress GitHub Sync][2]. You can probably guess what it does. The installation steps for [installing with the WordPress Dashboard][3] worked flawlessly. Now that I have the plugin setup, I can edit all my posts right on my own computer. I simply push to GitHub and voila. 

## You can contibute!

Now here's what I really want. I want you to help maintain this blog with me. If you read something useful but find something not quite right, fix it! If you learn something from here but can see how it might be confusing for someone else, update it! Let's give it a try right now by editing this page and putting your name on it. This will be especially fun if you're new to GitHub. 

1.  If you don't have a GitHub account yet, make one.
2.  Fork [this repository][1] by clicking the 'Fork' button in the top right.
3.  Navigate to this post. You will be able to find it in the _posts directory.
4.  Open this file by clicking on it's name in GitHub.
5.  Edit this file by clicking on the 'Edit this file' pencil in the top right.
6.  Add your name and GitHub username to the bottom of the list like: 
    * Chris Brackert [hansmosh][4]
7. Let's add a good commit message: "Adds 'Chris Brackert' to list of contributors.".
8. And click 'Commit changes'.
9. Back at the main page of the project, you'll see a little circular arrow button in the top left for 'Compare, review, create a pull request'. Click that.
10. On the next page, review your changes, and if you're satisfied click the 'Create pull request' button.

I'll be sure to merge in the change as soon as I get the chance! Thanks you for your conribution. I hope it is the first of many.
